IT WAS FELLING NIGHT, and the usual crowd had gathered at the Waystone Inn. Five wasn‟t much of a crowd, but five was as many as the Waystone ever saw these days, times being what they were.Old Cob was filling his role as storyteller and advice dispensary. The men at the bar sipped their drinks and listened. In the back room a young innkeeper stood out of sight behind the door, smiling as he listened to the details of a familiar story.“When he awoke, Taborlin the Great found himself locked in a high tower. They had taken his sword and stripped him of his tools: key, coin, and candle were all gone. But that weren‟t even the worst of it, you see...” Cob paused for effect, “...cause the lamps on the wall were burning blue!”
Graham, Jake, and Shep nodded to themselves. The three friends had grown up together, listening to Cob‟s stories and ignoring his advice.Cob peered closely at the newer, more attentive member of his small audience, the smith‟s prentice. “Do you know what that meant, boy?” Everyone called the smith‟s prentice “boy” despite the fact that he was a hand taller than anyone there. Small towns being what they are, he would most likely remain “boy” until his beard filled out or he bloodied someone‟s nose over the matter.The boy gave a slow nod. “The Chandrian.”“That‟s right,” Cob said approvingly. “TheChandrian. Everyone knows that blue fire is one of their signs. Now he was—”“But how‟d they find him?” the boy interrupted. “And why din‟t they kill him when they had the chance?”“Hush now, you‟ll get all the answers before the end,” Jake said. “Just let him tell it.”“No need for all that, Jake,” Graham said. “Boy‟s just curious. Drink your drink.”“I drank me drink already,” Jake grumbled. “I need t‟nother but the innkeep‟s still skinning rats in the back room.” He raised his voice and knocked his empty mug hollowly on the top of the mahogany bar. “Hoy! We‟re thirsty men in here!”The innkeeper appeared with five bowls of stew and two warm, round loaves of bread. He pulled more beer for Jake, Shep, and Old Cob, moving with an air of bustling efficiency.The story was set aside while the men tended to their dinners. Old Cob tucked away his bowl of stew with the predatory efficiency of a lifetime bachelor. The others were still blowing steam off their bowls when he finished the last of his loaf and returned to his story.“Now Taborlin needed to escape, but when he looked around, he saw his cell had no door. No windows. All around him was nothing but smooth, hard stone. It was a cell no man had ever escaped.“But Taborlin knew the names of all things, and soall things were his to command. He said to the stone: „Break!‟and the stone broke. The wall tore like a piece of paper, and through that hole Taborlin could see the sky and breathe the sweet spring air. He stepped to the edge, looked down, and without a second thought he stepped out into the open air....”The boy‟s eyes went wide. “He didn‟t!”Cob nodded seriously. “So Taborlin fell, but he did not despair. For he knew the name of the wind, and so the wind obeyed him. He spoke to the wind and it cradled andcaressed him. It bore him to the ground as gently as a puff of thistledown and set him on his feet softly as a mother‟s kiss.“And when he got to the ground and felt his side where they‟d stabbed him, he saw that it weren‟t hardly a scratch. Now maybe it was just a piece of luck,” Cob 
tapped the side of his nose knowingly. “Or maybe it had something to do with the amulet he was wearing under his shirt.”“What amulet?” the boy asked eagerly through a mouthful of stew.Old Cob leaned back on his stool, glad for the chance to elaborate. “A few days earlier, Taborlin had met a tinker on the road. And even though Taborlin didn‟t have much to eat, he shared his dinner with the old man.”“Right sensible thing to do,” Graham said quietly to the boy. “Everyone knows: „A tinker pays for kindness twice.‟”“No no,” Jake grumbled. “Get it right: „A tinker‟s advice pays kindness twice.‟”The innkeeper spoke up for the first time that night. “Actually, you‟re missing more than half,” he said, standing in the doorway behindthe bar.“A tinker‟s debt is always paid:Once for any simple trade.Twice for freely-given aid.Thrice for any insult made.”The men at the bar seemed almost surprised to see Kote standing there. They‟d been coming to the Waystone every Felling night formonths and Kote had never interjected anything of his own before. Not that you could expect anything else, really. He‟d only been in town for a year or so. He was still a stranger. The smith‟s prentice had lived here since he was eleven, and he was still referred to as “that Rannish boy,” as if Rannish were some foreign country and not a town less than thirty miles away.“Just something I heard once,” Kote said to fill the silence, obviously embarrassed.Old Cob nodded before he cleared his throat and launched back into the story. “Now this amulet was worth a whole bucket of gold nobles, but on account of Taborlin‟s kindness, the tinker sold it to him for nothing but an iron penny, a copper penny, and a silver penny. It was black as a winter night and cold as ice to touch, but so long as it was round his neck, Taborlin would be safe from the harm of evil things. Demons and such.”“I‟d give a good piece for such a thing these days,” Shep said darkly. He had drunk most and talked least over the course of the evening. Everyone knew that something bad had happened out on his farm last Cendling night, but since they were good friends they knew better than to press him for the details. At least not this early in the evening, not as sober as they were.“Aye, who wouldn‟t?” Old Cob said judiciously, taking a long drink.“I din‟t know the Chandrian were demons,” the boy said. “I‟d heard—”“They ain‟t demons,” Jake said firmly. “They were the first six people to refuse Tehlu‟s choice of the path, and he cursed them to wander the corners—”“Are you telling this story, Jacob Walker?” Cob said sharply. “Cause if you are, I‟ll just let you get on with it.”
